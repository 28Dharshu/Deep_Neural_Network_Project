# Deep_Neural_Network_Project
This project separates waste into Recyclable and Non-Recyclable categories. Recyclable items like paper, plastic, and metal are directed to one side, while non-recyclable waste such as food scraps and contaminated materials are separated into another. This helps improve waste management, supports recycling, and reduces environmental pollution.
